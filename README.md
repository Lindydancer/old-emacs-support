# old-emacs-support - Features needed to use old Emacs versions

This package provides features needed to use my packages on older
Emacs versions. Supported Emacs versions are 22.x, 23.x, and 24.x.

In addition, this package can patch known problems in earlier Emacs
versions, for things that are related to my packages.

I have opted to implement backward compatibility support in a
separate package, rather than let each package handle it themselves.

One reason for this is to make packages simpler to read. Another is
to make life easier for FSF in case they would include my packages
in future Emacs distributions.
